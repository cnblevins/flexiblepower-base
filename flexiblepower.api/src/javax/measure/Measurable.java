/**
 * This interface represents the measurable, countable, or comparable property or aspect of a thing.
 *
 * Implementing instances are typically the result of a measurement:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Measurable&lt;Mass&gt; weight = Measure.valueOf(180.0, POUND);
 * </pre>
 *
 * They can also be created from custom classes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Delay implements Measurable&lt;Duration&gt; {
 *     private long nanoSeconds; // Implicit internal unit.
 *     public double doubleValue(Unit&lt;Velocity&gt; unit) { ... }
 *     public long longValue(Unit&lt;Velocity&gt; unit) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * Thread.wait(new Delay(24, HOUR)); // Assuming Thread.wait(Measurable&lt;Duration&gt;) method.
 * </pre>
 *
 * Although measurable instances are for the most part scalar quantities; more complex implementations (e.g. vectors,
 * data set) are allowed as long as an aggregate magnitude can be determined. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class Velocity3D implements Measurable&lt;Velocity&gt; {
 *     private double x, y, z; // Meter per seconds.
 *     public double doubleValue(Unit&lt;Velocity&gt; unit) { ... } // Returns vector norm.
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * class Sensors&lt;Q extends Quantity&gt; extends Measure&lt;double[], Q&gt; {
 *     public doubleValue(Unit&lt;Q&gt; unit) { ... } // Returns median value.
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
