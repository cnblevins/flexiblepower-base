/**
 * The {@link ObservationProvider} is any object that wants to publish {@link Observation}s to a
 * {@link ObservationConsumer}. When using OSGi, there are a couple of properties that should be registered to make it
 * easier for consumers to find the proper providers.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>org.flexiblepower.monitoring.observedBy</code>: describes the component that does the observations.
 * Normally this will be the name of the component itself.
 * <li><code>org.flexiblepower.monitoring.observationOf</code>: describes the physical thing that it is observing.
 * <li><code>org.flexiblepower.monitoring.type</code>: gives the full classname of the type of value that will be
 * published by the provider.
 * <li><code>org.flexiblepower.monitoring.type.X</code>: for each attribute, the X is replaced by the name of the
 * attribute (as will be returned by the {@link Observation#getValueMap() method} and the value is the type description,
 * usually the classname.
 * <li><code>org.flexiblepower.monitoring.type.X.unit</code>: optionally describes the unit in which the attribute will
 * be transformed. This is only relevant for raw values, like doubles or integers.
 * <li><code>org.flexiblepower.monitoring.type.X.optional</code>: optionally describes if an attribute is optional. By
 * default the consumer may assume that all attributes are available each time, but by setting this to true it can
 * indicate otherwise.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @author TNO
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            The type of value that will be in the published observations.
